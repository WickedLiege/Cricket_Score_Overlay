# Cricket_Score_Overlay

I have successfully designed, developed, and deployed a robust dynamic cricket scores chrome extension using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. This extension efficiently delivers real-time updates to users, ensuring they are promptly informed about the latest cricket scores. To enhance the user experience, I carefully designed a visually appealing and user-friendly interface, utilizing HTML and CSS to create an immersive environment for cricket enthusiasts. Leveraging the power of JavaScript, I implemented functionality to retrieve and parse live data from reliable sources. As a result, the extension is able to seamlessly display up-to-date scores in real-time, providing users with the most accurate and current information. With this extension, cricket fans can stay engaged and informed with the latest cricket scores while enjoying a visually appealing interface.
